However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.</p>

                            <p class="description">Thor:Love The Thunder: MCU back in a day had some sense. Everything introduced had some sense and is well explained. Now in phase 4 most random sh#t is thrown at us. Zeus, seriously? Palace of gods, tf? Me personally, I dont like it because its clear sign writers are running out of ideas. This is hot mess with terrible terrible comedy. Thor in infinity war and this one are not same characters honestly.</p>

                            <p class="description">Thor:Love The Thunder: It will be better they tell descent amount of Gorr backstory. The length of movie seems 30 minutes short. They could have used more christian bale acting skills. Too much comedy was not necessarily required. Korg was waste. Bale, portman, thor, valkiry great. Story seems below average. They made Zeus joke. They should have done better

                                Overall not bad.</p>

                            <p class="description">RRR: This movie takes us to a world with emotional roller coaster ride, patriotism and strong characters. Every character has its own journey and a unique place in the story. I didn't expected VFX to be this good, I mean it was literally stunning to watch it in imax. The visual experience is what was very different from other movies.

                                Overall this is an festival which should be celebrated by everyone.</p>

                            <p class="description">RRR:This is one of the rare Rajamouli films with weakest antagonist after Vikramarkudu. The first half is brilliant and the interval is bang on. The flashback portions are great. But, the climax did not click inspite of fantastic VFX. The movie does not disappoint or lags at any point, and is a good film but not a great one!! </p>

                            <p class="description">Jurassic World Dominion: They forgot why we loved Jurassic Park!When I go to a Jurassic Park movie, I want something above all else-hyper realistic dinosaurs in cool environments, seeing them frolic in natural habitat, defend territory, battle other dinos for dominance, hunt humans, and the like. From the opening island scene with the brachiosaurus to the T-Rex reveal in the rainstorm, dinosaurs were front and center in the original Jurassic Park, inspiring a sense of grandeur and awe. The dinosaurs were what mattered, and everything else was peripheral-even the plot to get off the island. </p>

                            <p class="description">Jurassic World Dominion: See the original! This is my least favorite of all the Jurassic movies. The original was excellent and fun. This was an excuse to have a reunion. The movie can't stand on its own. I watched it with someone who had never seen any of the previous Jurassic movies. He didn't get it. I thought we were passed films that allowed the stars to keep their makeup on after swimming through algea covered ponds. </p>
